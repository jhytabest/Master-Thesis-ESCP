# Issue #23: Add power analysis for regression models

Status: Draft implementation plan

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Root cause and implementation approach documented in this issue file
- [ ] Code and/or analysis updates committed in this PR
- [ ] Verification evidence added (tests, logs, or artifact diffs)
- [ ] Follow-up risks and limitations noted

## Implementation plan
- [ ] Define target effect sizes and sample assumptions for each regression family
- [ ] Implement power analysis utilities for linear/logistic/count model scenarios used here
- [ ] Generate power curves/tables for current sample size and plausible alternatives
- [ ] Integrate power summary into analysis report outputs
- [ ] Add tests for deterministic power calculations and table schema
