# Issue #24: Add industry fixed effects to regression models

Status: Draft implementation plan

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Root cause and implementation approach documented in this issue file
- [ ] Code and/or analysis updates committed in this PR
- [ ] Verification evidence added (tests, logs, or artifact diffs)
- [ ] Follow-up risks and limitations noted

## Implementation plan
- [ ] Identify industry coding field and validate category coverage/quality
- [ ] Implement fixed-effects specification (dummy encoding or absorbed FE approach)
- [ ] Check multicollinearity and sparse-category risks after FE inclusion
- [ ] Compare baseline vs FE model coefficients and goodness-of-fit
- [ ] Update report tables/interpretation to reflect within-industry estimates
