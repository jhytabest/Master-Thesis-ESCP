# Research local store artifacts

Files in this folder are generated by the research foundation pipeline and are intentionally versioned when they represent a reproducible checkpoint used by `research snapshot` and related analyses.

These JSONL artifacts allow:
- reproducible claim/paper linkage at a given NORTHSTAR SHA,
- snapshot delta comparisons across runs,
- reviewable research provenance in pull requests.

Ephemeral/local experiment outputs should not be committed.
